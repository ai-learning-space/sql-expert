# Data Grouping | GROUP BY üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

In the world of databases, analyzing large datasets often requires more than just retrieving raw data, it demands a method to organize and summarize that information effectively. This is where the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL comes into play.

By allowing users to group rows sharing common values in specified columns, `GROUP BY` makes it possible to perform aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT` and `AVG` on these groups. This powerful feature not only simplifies complex queries but also enhances data analysis, enabling better insights and decision-making.

üìñ `GROUP BY` is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns and then perform aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN` on those groups.

Let's execute the query:

```sql
SELECT id, plane_name, departure_city, arrival_city
FROM flight;
```

Good, we obtained information about each flight. But what if we want information not about each individual record, but about the groups they form?

For example, these groups could be defined by:

- *Departure City* ‚Üí *‚ÄúHow many flights we have from City A?‚Äù*
- *Plane Name* ‚Üí *‚ÄúHow many flights we have per plane?‚Äù*
- ‚Ä¶

These groups include different records in the table and, consequently, have various characteristics that can be very useful to us. Such useful information about the groups could include:

- *Total number of flights per plane*
- *Air company with the biggest number of flights*
- ‚Ä¶

To answer all these and many other questions, we use the `GROUP BY` operator.

# GROUP BY Logic üß©

All we have to do is just to define `GROUP BY` keyword and *columns* on which we would like to create those groups for following aggregation operations.

```sql
SELECT agg_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_a, column_b;
```

Once `GROUP BY` is applied we don‚Äôt work with single *records* anymore, we work with *groups*! As a result, we cannot simply select any field from a *record* as we could before. This is because each *group* may contain multiple *records*, each of which may have different values in those fields.

For example, let‚Äôs find out how many unique flights has each air company in ‚ÄúAir Flights‚Äù database:

```sql
SELECT plane_name, COUNT(DISTINCT plane)
FROM flight
GROUP BY air_company;
```

Above query can be visualized in the picture below:

- First we obtain groups defined in `GROUP BY`
- Aggregation function is applied to the groups ‚Üí `COUNT(DISTINCT plane)`

<aside>

üí° `GROUP BY` treats `NULL` values equal. If filed contains `NULL` , all rows will be placed in the same group.

let‚Äôs find out how many flights we have per plane:

```sql
SELECT plane_name, COUNT(*) AS flights_count
FROM flight
GROUP BY plane_name;
```

# Grouping by Two or More Fields ‚ûï

When grouping by two or more fields, the principle remains the same. However, the resulting groups are further divided into smaller groups based on the second grouping field.

```sql
SELECT plane_name, departure_city, COUNT(*) AS flights_count
FROM flight
GROUP BY plane_name, departure_city;
```

# Why Using GROUP BY? ü§î

- ***Data Summarization:***
    - Easily summarize and aggregate large datasets to gain insights.
- ***Enhanced Analysis:***
    - Enables more complex analysis by allowing calculations based on specific groups within your data.
- ***Cleaner Data Presentation:***
    - Helps in presenting data in a more organized and readable format, focusing on key metrics.
